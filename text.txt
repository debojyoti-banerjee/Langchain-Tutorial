Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
It includes areas like machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.
AI enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming.
It powers technologies such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
AI is used in industries like healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and entertainment.
There are two main types: narrow AI (task-specific) and general AI (human-like reasoning).
Machine learning, a subset of AI, uses algorithms to detect patterns in data.
Deep learning, a more complex form, uses neural networks to mimic human brain function.
Ethical concerns around AI include privacy, bias, and job displacement.
AI continues to evolve rapidly, shaping the future of technology and society.
