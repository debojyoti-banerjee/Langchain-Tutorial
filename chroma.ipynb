       " 'documents': ['Introduction To Hurst Exponent\\nThe Hurst exponent, so named after British hydrologist Harold Edwin Hurst, is a\\nprimary measure for the study of the long-term memory and self-similarity of time series\\ndata. It is a crucial measure across numerous fields such as geophysics, economics, finance,\\nand even environmental science, which offers insights into the persistence, trend, and\\nvolatility of the data over time.\\nIn this project, the Hurst exponent is determined through two methods: the Mul-\\ntifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) and the Rescaled Range\\n(R/S) method. The two methods are commonly used to determine the fractality of a\\ntime series, with the Hurst exponent determining if the time series is long-range depen-\\ndent or random.\\n• MF-DFA is a technique that specializes in studying the multifractal behavior of\\ntime series through detrending and investigating the fluctuations across scales. The\\ntechnique is especially handy when dealing with data that shows multifractality or\\nintricate self-similar structures.\\n• R/S method , however, is a more straightforward method founded on rescaling\\nthe range of partial sums of the time series. It is a straightforward estimate of the\\nHurst exponent and is extensively employed in time series data with long-range\\ndependencies.\\nThe objective of this project is to compute the Hurst exponent employing both ap-\\nproaches and compare them. In doing this, we are able to ensure the validity and accuracy\\nof these approaches in determining the Hurst exponent in real-world time series data.\\nSubsequent sections will outline the theory behind the Hurst exponent, describe how\\neach approach used to compute the Hurst exponent is done, and show the outcomes\\nderived using MF-DFA and the R/S method.\\n1',\n",
       "  'The Hurst Exponent\\nThe Hurst exponent (H) is a statistical parameter that is employed to describe the\\nlong-memory of time series data. The Hurst exponent gives the amount of persistence or\\nanti-persistence present in the data. The Hurst exponent can lie within the interval from\\n0 to 1, and it informs about the type of the time series:\\n• H <0.5: Represents an anti-persistent time series. This is a series that, if it is\\nrising at some point, will fall in the future, and vice versa.\\n• H = 0.5: Is a random walk, where the time series has no correlation between the\\npast and the future. This is the behavior of a Brownian motion.\\n• H >0.5: Indicates persistence or trend-following behavior. If the series is going\\nup, it will likely keep going up, and the reverse for declining trends.\\nThe Hurst exponent is used in hydrology, geophysics, economics, and finance to ana-\\nlyze the fractal nature of data and to forecast trends in the future.\\nMultifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA)\\nThe Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA)is a detection method\\nfor multifractality in time series data. It is an extension of the standard DFA(Detrended\\nFluctuation Analysis) and is best suited for time series with multifractal and complex\\nstructures.\\nThe MF-DFA method goes through the following steps:\\n1. Detrending: A polynomial fit (typically of order 1 or 2) is subtracted from non-\\noverlapping windows of the time series to eliminate trends in each window.\\n2. Fluctuation Analysis : The detrended time series is analyzed for fluctuations\\nacross a range of scales or window sizes.\\n3. Log-Log Plot: A log-log plot of the fluctuation function is drawn, and the slope\\nof the plot is the value of the Hurst exponent. The MF-DFA technique provides\\nfor the determination of various scaling exponents over various regions and hence\\nis particularly suitable for the analysis of multifractal behavior.\\nThe MF-DFA method is robust against trends and is capable of handling a broad\\nvariety of time series data, even with noise or non-stationary behavior.\\nRescaled Range (R/S) Method\\nThe Rescaled Range (R/S) technique is one of the oldest methods to compute the\\nHurst exponent and is based on the idea of rescaling the range of partial sums of a time\\nseries. The technique is simple and efficient for identifying long-range dependence in a\\ntime series.\\nThe technique includes the following steps:\\n2',\n",
       "  '1. Cumulative Sum: The data of the time series is transformed into a cumulative\\nsum sequence. This process converts the original data into a sequence of partial\\nsums.\\n2. Rescaling: The range of the cumulative sum is computed within a moving window.\\nThe range is rescaled by dividing it by the standard deviation of the series within\\nthe same window.\\n3. Analysis: The rescaled range is then plotted versus the window size, and a log-log\\nplot is made. The slope of this plot is equivalent to the Hurst exponent.\\nThe R/S method is simple to use and gives a straightforward estimation of the Hurst\\nexponent. It is, however, sensitive to data non-stationarity and might not work as well\\nas more sophisticated techniques such as MF-DFA for highly complicated or multifractal\\nseries.\\nComparison of MF-DFA and R/S Methods\\nMF-DFA and the R/S approach both try to estimate the Hurst exponent, but they differ\\nin terms of complexity and which type of time series they are capable of processing:\\n• MF-DFA is better for multifractal or non-stationary time series, since it has been\\ndesigned to identify multiple scaling exponents and is trend-robust.\\n• R/S method is easier to understand and use but could be less effective with\\nmultifractal series or series with strong trends.\\nAlthough there are these distinctions, both techniques can give very close values for the\\nHurst exponent when used on well-behaved time series, and thus it is useful to compare\\nthe output of both methods in order to gauge their dependability and stability.\\n3',\n",
       "  'MF-DFA Method - Step-by-Step Explanation\\nInput Time Series:\\n• Receiving the time series data (signal) as input is the first step. The signal usually\\ncorresponds to a series of observations over time.\\nCalculating the Profile:\\n• The time series data is shifted by subtracting its mean value. This is performed to\\ncenter the data around zero. Then, the cumulative sum of the mean-shifted data\\nis calculated, which is known as the profile of the signal. This profile assists in\\ncapturing the overall trend or behavior of the signal over time.\\nDefining the Scales:\\n• To process the data at various levels, we specify a number of scales. A scale is\\nbasically a window size for which the data will be processed. Here, the scales are\\nselected logarithmically from a minimum scale to a maximum scale. This enables\\nthe method to pick up fine and coarse variations in the data. A fixed number of\\nscales is chosen between these boundaries to compare various time window sizes.\\nSegmenting the Signal:\\n• The signal is split into non-overlapping segments for every scale. The number of\\nsegments varies with the scale and the overall length of the signal. Each segment\\ncorresponds to a portion of the signal that will be examined for fluctuations and\\ntrends.\\nDetrending the Data in Each Segment:\\n• A detrending is performed in each segment. This is done by fitting a straight\\nline (linear trend) to the segment’s data. The linear fit is then subtracted from\\nthe segment, and the root mean square (RMS) of the difference (residuals) is\\ncomputed. The RMS value measures the fluctuation (or deviation from the trend)\\nfor the segment. RMS error assists in quantifying the level of randomness or noise\\nwithin the segment with respect to the fitted trend.\\nCalculating the Fluctuation Function:\\n• After the RMS values for all segments are computed, a fluctuation function\\nis obtained. This function gives a summary of the fluctuation behavior at each\\nscale. If a particular value of q is chosen, the fluctuation function is obtained by\\naveraging the RMS values to the power of q. In certain situations, when q = 0 ,\\nthe logarithmic mean of the RMS values squared is employed instead.\\nLogarithmic Transformation:\\n• To more easily visualize the scaling relationship between the fluctuation function\\nand the scale, the values of the scale and the fluctuation function are converted to\\nlogarithms. This converts the data into a format where a linear relationship can be\\ndetermined, making it simpler to estimate the scaling exponent.\\nPerforming Linear Regression:\\n4',\n",
       "  '• The next step is to perform a linear regression between the logarithms of the\\nscale and the fluctuation function. This regression helps to determine the slope\\nof the relationship. The slope of the log-log plot represents the scaling exponent,\\nwhich is related to the Hurst exponent.\\nCalculating the Hurst Exponent:\\n• The slope from the regression is utilized to calculate the Hurst exponent (H) .\\nThe Hurst exponent is actually the value of the slope minus 1. If slope minus 1 is\\nnegative, the Hurst exponent is set as the slope. If the slope minus 1 is positive, it\\nis adjusted by setting slope minus 1 as slope minus 1.\\nOutput:\\n• The calculated Hurst exponent is the ultimate result of the MF-DFA procedure.\\nThis exponent gives information on the long-term memory or persistence of the\\ntime series. The Hurst exponent is usually printed and can be saved to a file for\\nlater analysis or reporting.\\n5',\n",

The signal usually\\nindicates a collection of data points recorded over time.\\nSetting the Scales:\\n• The process establishes a range of scales on which the analysis is done.

This log-\\narithmic selection allows for a wide range of scales to be tested, capturing both\\nshort-term and long-term behavior in the data.\\nDividing the Signal into Segments:\\n• For every scale, the signal is broken down into non-overlapping segments of corre-\\nsponding length. At scale 16, for instance, the signal is divided into segments of 16\\nunits of length. For each segment, the following computations are performed.\\nDetrending the Data:\\n• For every segment, the segment mean is computed and subtracted from every data\\npoint within the segment. This step brings the segment to zero and makes it simple\\nto examine the fluctuations around the mean.\\nCumulative Sum:\\n• The sum of the mean-adjusted segment is then accumulated. The cumulative sum\\nis the running total of deviations from the mean, which can be used to determine\\nthe overall trend and fluctuations in the segment.\\nDetermining the Range (R):\\n• The range (R) of the cumulative sum is calculated by determining the highest and\\nlowest values of the cumulative sum within each segment. The range is obtained\\nby subtracting the lowest from the highest value, which is a measure of the level of\\nchanges in the segment.\\nCalculating the Standard Deviation (S):\\n• The standard deviation (S) of the initial segment is calculated. The standard\\ndeviation calculates how much the points vary from the mean.\\nRescaled Range (R/S):\\n• The rescaled range (R/S) can be determined as a ratio between the range (R) and\\nthe standard deviation (S) of each segment. The resultant ratio is a measure of\\nnormalized fluctuation for the segment.\\nAverage Rescaled Range:\\n9',\n",
       "  '• For every scale, the mean of the R/S values across all segments is calculated. This\\nmean yields an estimate of the fluctuation across the entire signal at the scale.\\nLogarithmic Transformation:\\n• The scale values and the mean rescaled range values are both transformed by using\\nlogarithms (log base 2). This transformation linearizes the relationship between the\\nscale and the rescaled range, making it simpler to estimate the scaling exponent.\\nLinear Regression:\\n• A linear regression is conducted between the logarithms of the scale values and the\\nlogarithms of the average rescaled range values. The slope of the regression line is\\nthe scaling exponent, which is equivalent to the Hurst exponent.\\nHurst Exponent Calculation:\\n• The Hurst exponent (H) is calculated from the slope of the regression line. The\\nformula used to calculate the Hurst exponent is:\\nH = slope − 1\\n• If the slope minus 1 is negative, the Hurst exponent is used as the slope itself.\\n• If the slope minus 1 is positive, the Hurst exponent is shifted by subtracting 1 from\\nthe slope.\\nOutput:\\n• The last Hurst exponent is the result of the R/S method. This number gives a\\nmeasure of the long-term memory or persistence of the time series. The Hurst\\nexponent is usually printed and can also be written to a file for later analysis.\\n10',\n",

       " 'documents': ['The Hurst Exponent\\nThe Hurst exponent (H) is a statistical parameter that is employed to describe the\\nlong-memory of time series data. The Hurst exponent gives the amount of persistence or\\nanti-persistence present in the data. The Hurst exponent can lie within the interval from\\n0 to 1, and it informs about the type of the time series:\\n• H <0.5: Represents an anti-persistent time series. This is a series that, if it is\\nrising at some point, will fall in the future, and vice versa.\\n• H = 0.5: Is a random walk, where the time series has no correlation between the\\npast and the future. This is the behavior of a Brownian motion.\\n• H >0.5: Indicates persistence or trend-following behavior. If the series is going\\nup, it will likely keep going up, and the reverse for declining trends.\\nThe Hurst exponent is used in hydrology, geophysics, economics, and finance to ana-\\nlyze the fractal nature of data and to forecast trends in the future.\\nMultifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA)\\nThe Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA)is a detection method\\nfor multifractality in time series data. It is an extension of the standard DFA(Detrended\\nFluctuation Analysis) and is best suited for time series with multifractal and complex\\nstructures.\\nThe MF-DFA method goes through the following steps:\\n1. Detrending: A polynomial fit (typically of order 1 or 2) is subtracted from non-\\noverlapping windows of the time series to eliminate trends in each window.\\n2. Fluctuation Analysis : The detrended time series is analyzed for fluctuations\\nacross a range of scales or window sizes.\\n3. Log-Log Plot: A log-log plot of the fluctuation function is drawn, and the slope\\nof the plot is the value of the Hurst exponent. The MF-DFA technique provides\\nfor the determination of various scaling exponents over various regions and hence\\nis particularly suitable for the analysis of multifractal behavior.\\nThe MF-DFA method is robust against trends and is capable of handling a broad\\nvariety of time series data, even with noise or non-stationary behavior.\\nRescaled Range (R/S) Method\\nThe Rescaled Range (R/S) technique is one of the oldest methods to compute the\\nHurst exponent and is based on the idea of rescaling the range of partial sums of a time\\nseries. The technique is simple and efficient for identifying long-range dependence in a\\ntime series.\\nThe technique includes the following steps:\\n2',\n",
       "  '1. Cumulative Sum: The data of the time series is transformed into a cumulative\\nsum sequence. This process converts the original data into a sequence of partial\\nsums.\\n2. Rescaling: The range of the cumulative sum is computed within a moving window.\\nThe range is rescaled by dividing it by the standard deviation of the series within\\nthe same window.\\n3. Analysis: The rescaled range is then plotted versus the window size, and a log-log\\nplot is made. The slope of this plot is equivalent to the Hurst exponent.\\nThe R/S method is simple to use and gives a straightforward estimation of the Hurst\\nexponent. It is, however, sensitive to data non-stationarity and might not work as well\\nas more sophisticated techniques such as MF-DFA for highly complicated or multifractal\\nseries.\\nComparison of MF-DFA and R/S Methods\\nMF-DFA and the R/S approach both try to estimate the Hurst exponent, but they differ\\nin terms of complexity and which type of time series they are capable of processing:\\n• MF-DFA is better for multifractal or non-stationary time series, since it has been\\ndesigned to identify multiple scaling exponents and is trend-robust.\\n• R/S method is easier to understand and use but could be less effective with\\nmultifractal series or series with strong trends.\\nAlthough there are these distinctions, both techniques can give very close values for the\\nHurst exponent when used on well-behaved time series, and thus it is useful to compare\\nthe output of both methods in order to gauge their dependability and stability.\\n3',\n",
       "  'MF-DFA Method - Step-by-Step Explanation\\nInput Time Series:\\n• Receiving the time series data (signal) as input is the first step. The signal usually\\ncorresponds to a series of observations over time.\\nCalculating the Profile:\\n• The time series data is shifted by subtracting its mean value. This is performed to\\ncenter the data around zero. Then, the cumulative sum of the mean-shifted data\\nis calculated, which is known as the profile of the signal. This profile assists in\\ncapturing the overall trend or behavior of the signal over time.\\nDefining the Scales:\\n• To process the data at various levels, we specify a number of scales. A scale is\\nbasically a window size for which the data will be processed. Here, the scales are\\nselected logarithmically from a minimum scale to a maximum scale. This enables\\nthe method to pick up fine and coarse variations in the data. A fixed number of\\nscales is chosen between these boundaries to compare various time window sizes.\\nSegmenting the Signal:\\n• The signal is split into non-overlapping segments for every scale. The number of\\nsegments varies with the scale and the overall length of the signal. Each segment\\ncorresponds to a portion of the signal that will be examined for fluctuations and\\ntrends.\\nDetrending the Data in Each Segment:\\n• A detrending is performed in each segment. This is done by fitting a straight\\nline (linear trend) to the segment’s data. The linear fit is then subtracted from\\nthe segment, and the root mean square (RMS) of the difference (residuals) is\\ncomputed. The RMS value measures the fluctuation (or deviation from the trend)\\nfor the segment. RMS error assists in quantifying the level of randomness or noise\\nwithin the segment with respect to the fitted trend.\\nCalculating the Fluctuation Function:\\n• After the RMS values for all segments are computed, a fluctuation function\\nis obtained. This function gives a summary of the fluctuation behavior at each\\nscale. If a particular value of q is chosen, the fluctuation function is obtained by\\naveraging the RMS values to the power of q. In certain situations, when q = 0 ,\\nthe logarithmic mean of the RMS values squared is employed instead.\\nLogarithmic Transformation:\\n• To more easily visualize the scaling relationship between the fluctuation function\\nand the scale, the values of the scale and the fluctuation function are converted to\\nlogarithms. This converts the data into a format where a linear relationship can be\\ndetermined, making it simpler to estimate the scaling exponent.\\nPerforming Linear Regression:\\n4',\n",
       "  '• The next step is to perform a linear regression between the logarithms of the\\nscale and the fluctuation function. This regression helps to determine the slope\\nof the relationship. The slope of the log-log plot represents the scaling exponent,\\nwhich is related to the Hurst exponent.\\nCalculating the Hurst Exponent:\\n• The slope from the regression is utilized to calculate the Hurst exponent (H) .\\nThe Hurst exponent is actually the value of the slope minus 1. If slope minus 1 is\\nnegative, the Hurst exponent is set as the slope. If the slope minus 1 is positive, it\\nis adjusted by setting slope minus 1 as slope minus 1.\\nOutput:\\n• The calculated Hurst exponent is the ultimate result of the MF-DFA procedure.\\nThis exponent gives information on the long-term memory or persistence of the\\ntime series. The Hurst exponent is usually printed and can be saved to a file for\\nlater analysis or reporting.\\n5',\n",

The signal usually\\nindicates a collection of data points recorded over time.\\nSetting the Scales:\\n• The process establishes a range of scales on which the analysis is done. These ranges\\nfrom a minimum scale (16) to a maximum scale (N // 4, where N is the size of the\\nsignal).\\n• A total of 20 scales are selected logarithmically between these limits. This log-\\narithmic selection allows for a wide range of scales to be tested, capturing both\\nshort-term and long-term behavior in the data.\\nDividing the Signal into Segments:\\n• For every scale, the signal is broken down into non-overlapping segments of corre-\\nsponding length. At scale 16, for instance, the signal is divided into segments of 16\\nunits of length. For each segment, the following computations are performed.\\nDetrending the Data:\\n• For every segment, the segment mean is computed and subtracted from every data\\npoint within the segment. This step brings the segment to zero and makes it simple\\nto examine the fluctuations around the mean.\\nCumulative Sum:\\n• The sum of the mean-adjusted segment is then accumulated. The cumulative sum\\nis the running total of deviations from the mean, which can be used to determine\\nthe overall trend and fluctuations in the segment.\\nDetermining the Range (R):\\n• The range (R) of the cumulative sum is calculated by determining the highest and\\nlowest values of the cumulative sum within each segment. The range is obtained\\nby subtracting the lowest from the highest value, which is a measure of the level of\\nchanges in the segment.\\nCalculating the Standard Deviation (S):\\n• The standard deviation (S) of the initial segment is calculated. The standard\\ndeviation calculates how much the points vary from the mean.\\nRescaled Range (R/S):\\n• The rescaled range (R/S) can be determined as a ratio between the range (R) and\\nthe standard deviation (S) of each segment. The resultant ratio is a measure of\\nnormalized fluctuation for the segment.\\nAverage Rescaled Range:\\n9',\n",
       "  '• For every scale, the mean of the R/S values across all segments is calculated. This\\nmean yields an estimate of the fluctuation across the entire signal at the scale.\\nLogarithmic Transformation:\\n• The scale values and the mean rescaled range values are both transformed by using\\nlogarithms (log base 2). This transformation linearizes the relationship between the\\nscale and the rescaled range, making it simpler to estimate the scaling exponent.\\nLinear Regression:\\n• A linear regression is conducted between the logarithms of the scale values and the\\nlogarithms of the average rescaled range values. The slope of the regression line is\\nthe scaling exponent, which is equivalent to the Hurst exponent.\\nHurst Exponent Calculation:\\n• The Hurst exponent (H) is calculated from the slope of the regression line.

Notably, the highest values are concentrated\\naround 0.60-0.62, while the values at the lower end remain between 0.51-0.55. This\\nindicates a relatively stable signal with slight fluctuations.\\nSignal 2: Signal 2 shows relatively consistent values, mostly between 0.37 and 0.42, with\\noccasional slight peaks at 0.41 and 0.42. The variation is minimal compared to Signal 1,\\nwhich suggests this signal is more stable with fewer large fluctuations.\\nSignal 3: Signal 3 fluctuates more significantly, with values ranging from 0.20 to 0.30.\\nThere are higher frequencies of values between 0.22 and 0.26, with notable spikes at 0.29\\nand 0.30. The variability in this signal suggests it might have a more dynamic behavior\\nthan the first two signals.\\nSignal 4: Signal 4 displays values between 0.32 and 0.43, with a slightly higher con-\\ncentration around 0.39 and 0.41. The overall pattern is similar to Signal 2, with small\\ndeviations indicating moderate fluctuations in the signal.\\n14'],\n",
