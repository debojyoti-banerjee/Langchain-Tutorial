      "Wait, should I include his personal life? Maybe briefly mention Anushka Sharma since it's public knowledge, but focus on cricket. Stats are important: centuries, records. But don't overwhelm with numbers. Emphasize his impact beyond stats—how he inspired fitness in the team. \n",
      "\n",
      "User's deeper needs? They might want to understand his significance in cricket history or why he's so popular. Maybe comparing him to other greats? Or looking for his current status after stepping down as captain. Also, check if they need recent info, like his form post-captaincy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to mention his nickname \"King Kohli\" and the chase master angle. That resonates with fans. Also, his role in modernizing Indian cricket's fitness standards.
